# Blockchain-Datastructure

Bitcoin : One transection in 10 minutes.
nonce : is a number - proff of work - is a ligtimate block
(nonce came form proof of work)
Hashing Algorithm : 
SHA256 HASHING ALGORITHM : secure hash alogorthm  
hash :  is a sequence of algorithm - a random string with fix length


proof of work: gives seurity to blockchain(collection of blocks). //ligtimate mining
what actually proof of work do?
--it takes hash of sha256 - 
--if a particular hash is not generated then proof of work is running
